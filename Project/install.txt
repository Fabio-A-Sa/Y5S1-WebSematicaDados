# WSDL Project

Wordify is a system that disambiguates existing entities, possibly in different languages, using Web Semantics and Linked Data principles, concepts, and technologies. It will help a computer and humans to perceive which entity is being referred to, if it is ambiguous in a certain context, or to consult false friends between languages.

## Installation & Run

## Google Knowledge Graph 

Explain how your assigned example uses web semantics and linked data:
- Web semantics:
    - data becomes interpretable, not only for humans, but also by machines;
    - This is allowed by the use of structured data and metadata, that allows machines to recognize search terms as entities, and not only simple Keywords. So, its core purpose is basically to define relationships between data on the web as a way machines can understand, by using, for example, RDF's, that allow to represent the relationships by triplets.

- Linked data:
    - Due to its graph structured, the data 
    - In what concerns to linked data, it is basically what enables the actual connection of disparate data sources across the web into a single network of entities. This is the reason why, when we search a term, for example, "Paris", suggested searches related to it, like "Eiffel Tower" are presented.

Reflect on potential challenges in implementing linked data, like interoperability or data consistency:
- only individual matching entities;
- This implies:
    - Missing entity Relationships;
    - Need for making multiple requests => manual entity linking;
    - Reduced Semantinc Inference

How does this application use structured data? 
- Yes, it uses the JSON-LD format, which is compatible with schema.org schemes, with a several group of attributes/tags/whatever;

What are the main benefits of using web semantics or linked data in this context? 
- Incorporates data for multiple sources;
- Entity-Centric Knowledge, giving a more meaningful representation of relationships between entities;
- In what concerns to linked data, it is basically what enables the actual connection of disparate data sources across the web into a single network of entities. This is the reason why, when we search a term, for example, "Paris", suggested searches related to it, like "Eiffel Tower" are presented.

What role do LLMs play (for Google/IBM examples)?
- LLMs (Large Language Models) are used to interpret/solve complex queries and queries based on complex contexts
